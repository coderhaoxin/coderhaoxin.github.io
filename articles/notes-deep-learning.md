### Structuring Deep Learning Projects

* Orthogonalization
  - Happy cost function
  - Performs well in real world
* Single number evaluation metric
  - Combine metrics
* Satisficing and Optimizing metric
* Train/dev/test distributions
  - Dev Test sets really come from the same distribution

### Sequence models

* RNN
* LSTM
