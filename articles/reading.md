  - 简评: 不凡的经历, 朴实的文字, 是直击内心的颤动
  - 金句: 自我实现不在关注自身, 必定是真正地投入到一段关系, 一个事业中去

```
只有在特殊的时代, 特殊的经历, 特殊的人, 才能成就此书.
一代心理学大师的著作(关键是, 内容短小震撼)
书中妙语诸多, 加上那一份切身经历的沉重, 可叹作者之: 伟大
```

最经典的一段话摘录如下:

```
By declaring that man is responsible and must
actualize the potential meaning of his life,
I wish to stress that the true meaning of life
is to be discovered in the world rather than
within man or his own psyche,
as though it were a closed system.
I have termed this constitutive characteristic
"the self-transcendence of human existence."
It denotes the fact that being human always points,
and is directed, to something or someone,
other than oneself--be it a meaning to fulfill
or another human being to encounter.
The more one forgets himself--by giving himself
to a cause to serve or another person to love--the
more human he is and the more he actualizes himself.

What is called self-actualization is not an
attainable aim at all, for the simple reason that
the more one would strive for it, the more he would miss it.
In other words, self-actualization is possible
only as a side-effect of self-transcendence.
```

```
人之所以为人，是因为他总是指向某种事物或某人（他自己以外的某人）
——不论是作为有待实现的意义还是需要面对的他人。
人越是忘记自己——投身于某种事业或献身于所爱的人——他就越有人性，
越能实现自己的价值。

所谓自我实现，绝不是指某种可以实现的目标，
因为人越是追求这个目标，越是容易失去它。换句话说，
自我实现可能是自我超越唯一的副产品。
```
