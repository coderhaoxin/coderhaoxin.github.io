```
Theoretical / mathematical physics at the graduate level and above.
This is NOT a popular science channel.
Here you find real theoretical physicists doing real theoretical physics.
We think it is important for people to get a taste of the real deal,
and for aspiring theoretical physicists to see what they are working towards,
i.e., to provide the public with something beyond
the ubiquitous Michio Kaku and Brian Cox.
